1d wrapped distance function:

d1(l, a, b) = l/2 - |l/2 - (|a-b| % l)|

Where d is distance, l is the limit (or maximum) of the axis (0 being the implicit minimum),
a is one position and b is the other position.

2d wrapped distance function:

d2(l, a, b) = sqrt(d1(l.x, a.x, b.x)^2 + d1(l.y, a.y, b.y)^2)


1d wrapped subtraction:

s(l, a, b) = d1(l, a, b) * sgn(a - b)
